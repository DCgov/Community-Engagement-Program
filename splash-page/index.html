            <h3>What is SpeakUp?</h3>
            <p>This is a tool to gather opinions from residents about their experiences and priorities. The purpose of SpeakUp
                is to spark conversations between government and residents, starting with a quick survey or poll. People
                in DC Government then use the results of SpeakUp to make decisions, communicate with residents, and drive
                change. These results are shared transparently so that residents can see how their feedback has influenced
                decisions and the City.</p>

                        Every resident of DC deserves a voice in these decisions. We aim to collect inclusive, representative
                        feedback so that City decision-makers can be better informed about the residents affected by their
                        decisions.

                    <p>DC Government would like to bring residents into decision making, including the SpeakUp process and tools.
                        The public has already played a role in shaping SpeakUp through our work at the
                        <a href="https://twitter.com/MarieCWhittaker/status/992825354472615936" target="_blank">2018 InnoMAYtion hackathon</a>
                        and our public naming campaign. This site is created as a prototype using a
                        <em>Test and Learn</em> process. Prototypes are created as an inexpensive way to introduce learning from
                        users into the process of design. By raising the importance of users, we create a better product.
                        However, this means that some less important parts of the site aren't fully built or tested.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's important for you to know that all of the surveys are real. Your responses will be used to make decisions, and we plan
                        to show you exactly how your input mattered by sharing the results publicly as quickly as possible.
                        In addition, we are using a mature, industry-leading survey tool. What we are testing is how we can
                        best capture and represent resident perspectives through this site and other SpeakUp approaches.
